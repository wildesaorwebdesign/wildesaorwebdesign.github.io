          <p>Trauma can be a masterful teacher.  Never letting that trauma define who you are, but at the same time honoring the way it shapes
             you is a fine balancing act indeed.  Kyla takes her one-on-one
              experience with death and uses it to help and heal those around
              her.Once she found her path out…she never looked back. She
              watched as her life transformed around her, and even though she
               struggles to accept the beauty the universe has blessed her with
                through the love of her husband and one-year old son, she can
                never forget how she arrived at this place.

          <p align="right">She is a shaman, a priestess, a wind-walker who feels a deep
             connection to the people and all things around her. Kyla is
            an ordained minister and a Reiki practitioner who has studied
            Arts Management at the University of Tulsa (2006), and a
            Recovery Support Specialist with an emphasis on substance
            abuse and trauma (Oklahoma State University, 2016).

          <p>Kyla’s spiritual studies are primarily focused on the chakras,
            animal medicine, the ways of our ancestors, feminism, and the
            divine harmony between everything on Earth and beyond. She is both
            spiritual and analytical, and she brings her authentic perspective
            to all her work.
