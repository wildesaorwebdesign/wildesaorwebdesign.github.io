    Thank you so much for being a part of our first subscription box!!

This is a dream of ours and we honored you have joined this journey with us!

General Moon energy information:

The Strawberry moon is a time when we see the first fruits of our hard work, but the season of showing what we've been growing has only just begun!


The new moon comes to us on June 3rd in the air sign of Gemini.
Gemini rules the face and the nervous system. Gemini is the sign that works on balancing two masks.
The moon moves into cancer on the 4th, but this Gemini energy is carried throughout the summer solstice.


The Full moon arrives June 17 in the earth sign of Capricorn. Capricorn rules our bones and joints.
Capricorn is arguably one of the more stronger and resilient signs of the zodiac and they constantly remind us to reconnect with our roots.


Descriptions of your products and suggestions to help best infuse the moon energy:

Step one daily mantra - your mantra for the 6th moon cycle of the year :

The yin and yang
Light within, light without
What I seek with the torch of my soul , is myself because I, I am whole.

Write this on the top of your calendar and say it as often as possible. It’s a great way to start the day! Or put it on a sticky note on your mirror - just make it part of your daily routine!

Crystal- Moonstone -
Moonstone is the great stabilizer of emotions, while it is commonly associated with yin energy, it also about balancing your yin and your yang energies.
Hold this stone whenever you need help balancing your whole self.


New moon :
Our Black Sugar strawberry honey face mask is messy, but that’s all a part the intention!
We ask that release your inner truth and strip the mask you force yourself to wear everyday.
Think about the aspects of true self you are hiding away.
Scrub away (gently for sensitive skin)
Then watch as both masks circle down the drain and get carried away.
(We highly suggest you wash off in the shower)

Then use your sample of our Cannabis root and rose salve as a moisturizer on your face- just a little goes a long way and your face will be baby smooth! Brand new and glowing for the true you!

***this is the best time to plant a seed of intention or a wish that you would like to see come to fruition by the full moon*****

Full moon-

Strawberry moon tea light from Moon Candles-
When you burn this candle, meditate on what you would like to accomplish throughout this summer and over the coming year!

Black sugar scrub/ Salt soak combination:
We created this as a way to reconnect the full moon energy with that of the new moon- making it all come full circle.

Use your bottle of rose hemp oil to mix with the black sugar and chamomile on any rough/dry areas that need attention.
Or
-rub it over your feet and imagine the black being dirt from Mother Earth and visualize actual roots growing from your feet.
-rub some on your belly! Well your solar plexus (above your belly button!) rather in a counter clockwise motion to get your powerful energy moving!

Then show your bones how grateful you are that they carry you every day with the salt soak and cornflower.
Meditate on your wish from the new moon if you made one, or just reflect on the month!

All bottles have been sealed with intentions- wax melted down by the flame of a candle by Moon Candles!

If you have any more questions please do not hesitate to contact us!

Moonbeams and sweet dreams!
